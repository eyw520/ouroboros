# Engineering Conventions

Shared conventions first; the repo's own map, invariants, and gotchas follow below (CLAUDE.md stays a thin pointer here).
When this file and an enforcing hook disagree, the hook wins — fix whichever is wrong in the same commit.

## First principles

1. Code self-describes through naming and structure; a comment or docstring earns its place only when it adds what the code cannot say — the why, a non-obvious constraint — and then it is one line, dense, and evergreen.
   Never narrate what the code does, the change you made, or its correctness; a comment that restates the code means delete the comment or rename the code.
2. Never use emojis in generated code.
3. Do not generate markdown files unless instructed to do so.
4. Prose in Markdown is one sentence per line — never hard-wrap.
   Single newlines render as spaces, so this is invisible to readers while keeping diffs and blame line-precise.
   (Tables, code blocks, and list items stay one line each.)

## The gate

- `make check` is the gate: lint + format check + typecheck + tests. Run all of it before declaring work done.
- `make fmt` auto-fixes what the gate would flag.
- `make dev` once on a fresh clone: installs dependencies and wires the git hooks; dormant until then.
- The pre-commit hook runs the secret scan and the gate, cached by tree hash; `--no-verify` is for emergencies — CI still runs the gate.
- The gate is incremental: every tool that can cache, caches. A warm no-change gate should cost seconds; treat a slow warm gate as a defect.
- Where CI exists, it runs exactly `make check` — local and CI cannot drift.

## Commit messages

- Format: `<type>(<scope>): Sentence case ending with period.` — subject only, no trailers.
  Some repos drop the scope; `.githooks/commit-msg` is the source of truth for exact types and scopes.
- Base types: feat, fix, docs, chore, clean, revert. Repos may extend.
- Backtick code identifiers and filenames in the subject.
- One logical change per commit (one fix, one feature, one phase); a snapshot or doc truth-keeping edit rides the commit that caused it.
- For a bug fix, land the failing test with the fix.
- Commit locally and stop: pushing is the operator's review step.
